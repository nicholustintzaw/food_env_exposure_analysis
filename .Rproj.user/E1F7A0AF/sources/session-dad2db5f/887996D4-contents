# R Script Workflow for Static Food Environment Exposure Analysis: A Reproducible Example

This repository provides a practical example of an R script workflow used for static food environment exposure analysis. It is intended as a resource for colleagues working on similar projects and is not meant to be a definitive technical guideline. The scripts and documentation are designed to be easily adaptable and reusable, promoting transparency and reproducibility in your research.

This workflow demonstrates the step-by-step process of preparing spatial data, calculating relevant metrics, and generating visualizations for assessing food environments. While tailored to my specific experience, it can serve as a valuable starting point for your own analyses.
